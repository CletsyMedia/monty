## Introduction

Welcome to Monty 0.98, a script language akin to Python, employing Monty bytecodes. It orchestrates an exclusive stack structure, guided by specialized instructions, creating a melodious blend of code and innovation in a compact, stack-based realm.
Join us on this collaborative odyssey, where we unravel the secrets of Monty bytecode, combining simplicity and ingenuity. Together, we compose a digital sonnet, crafting a world where code and creativity unite in open-source harmony.

## Monty byte code files

Monty byte code files bear the .m extension, an industry norm but not a language requirement. Each line in these files features a single instruction, allowing flexible spacing around the opcode and its argument. More details and examples can be found in the examples section.

## 🌟 Objectives

- 🧐 Unravel the mysteries of LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) like a Monty magician.
- 📚 Grasp the essence of stacks and their ideal use cases, letting you wield their power with finesse.
- 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️ Explore the realm of queues, understanding their purpose and when to deploy them in the coding adventure.
- 🧮 Dive into various implementations of stacks and queues, learning the alchemy that makes them tick.
- 🌆 Discover the most common scenarios where stacks and queues shine, becoming a wise code architect.
- 🧪 Experiment with global variables, understanding their role in the Monty orchestra, as you compose a symphony of code.
- 🧙‍♂️ Embrace the art of data structures, forging your path to Monty mastery.
- 🌌 Traverse the universe of memory allocation, dancing through its intricate steps with elegance.
- 🪄 Weave the threads of error handling into your code tapestry, ensuring Monty's reliability.
- 🚀 Embark on an epic journey in code optimization, unlocking Monty's hidden powers and making your spells more potent with each enchanting line.

## Monty Interpreter Testing

### Testing LIFO Magic

1. Create a new Monty script file named `lifo_test.m` and open it with your favorite text editor.
2. Add the following Monty bytecode to the script:

   ```plaintext
   push 1
   push 2
   push 3
   pall

3. Save the script file and close the text editor.
4. In your terminal, run the Monty interpreter with the script:

    ```bash
    ./monty lifo_test.m
    ```

5. Witness the magic as it displays the values in LIFO (Last In,  First Out) order:

    ```plaintext
    3
    2 
    1
    ```
